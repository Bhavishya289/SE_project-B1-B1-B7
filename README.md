2. Validate Fast
a. Paper prototypes -> Figma → Functional React demos

b. Tested with 20+ students (iterated on search/UI pain points)

3. Build Measurably
a. Prioritized frontend MVP (proved UX before backend)

b. Used mock data for demo-ready validation

REQUIREMENTS----

### testing method-
1. Manual Testing-
Component & integration checks (React)

UI/UX (responsiveness, animations, accessibility)

2. User Feedback-
Peer reviews & hallway testing

### Challenges & Fixes-

1. Animation Lag -> Simplified Framer Motion + CSS optimizations.

2. Mobile Bugs -> Swipe thresholds + max-width: 100%.

3. Mock Data -> Structured JSON + simulated API delays.

4. Auth Errors -> Regex + clear validation messages.

5. State Chaos -> React Context + modular components.

Result: Smoother UI, scalable code.
